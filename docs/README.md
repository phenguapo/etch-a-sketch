# Etch-a-Sketch Project

This project creates a simple Etch-a-Sketch drawing application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

The Etch-a-Sketch project aims to replicate the functionality of the classic toy, allowing users to draw and erase on a grid-based canvas using their mouse. The project utilizes basic HTML, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. Created as a mean to learn better DOM manipulation. Assignment was given by [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch)

### Project Structure

- **HTML**: The `index.html` file contains the structure of the webpage, including the grid container and buttons.
- **CSS**: The `style.css` file styles the elements on the webpage, defining grid layout, colors, and button styles.
- **JavaScript**: The `script.js` file contains the logic for drawing on the grid and handling user interactions.

### Functionality

- The grid is generated dynamically using JavaScript upon page load.
- Users can hover over grid cells to draw by changing the cell color.
- The "Clear" button resets the grid, allowing users to start drawing from scratch.
